# Modified (Simplified) Truffle React Box

Modified this:
https://truffleframework.com/boxes/react

- updated React to the latest version
- Use async await (instead of promise chains) in App.js
- Very simple contract
- Event works
- Test is not yet changed, so it fails.
- Simple GetStarted Boilerplate for myself

- Install Truffle globally.
```npm install -g truffle```
- Clone this repo
- npm install
- Run the development console.

- ```truffle develop```
- ```compile```
- ```migrate```
- ```npm run start```
